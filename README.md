## What is Bitcoin Tontine?

50 players enter a pool with 10 tokens each. Every player must ping regularly to stay alive. Miss your ping and you are liquidated — your funds distributed to survivors proportionally by seniority. Last survivor wins everything.

## Game Mechanics

- 50 players per pool (historical count)
- Ping interval: 7 days → accelerates to 1 hour minimum
- 3 hunting bullets per pool (available after 70% of game)
- Counter-hunt: if target pings during hunt window, hunter loses bullet + 5% penalty
- Points system: veterans earn more from liquidations
- 0.3% protocol fee on every liquidation
